Flyover Construction for Traffic Density in a City

In recent years, analysis of traffic in a city has emerged as a hot topic both academically and practically. In particular, the tracking of moving objects in road networks is becoming quite popular. Traffic density is used to update driving time estimates in real time or warn police of potential problem areas. In this work, we address the problem of discovering that densest route in a road network and we will construct a flyover to provide an alternate route. City officials can use them to improve traffic flow. Store owners and advertisers can use them to better position their properties. Police official scan use them to maximize patrol coverage.

INPUT:
Number of vertices
Number of edges
Edges using adjacency list
Weight of the edges containing the following:
Density of the traffic
Length of the road
Starting Node
Maximum length of the highway
OUTPUT:
The path for the flyover to be constructed where the traffic is densest
